## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I decided to use no Framework to test my knowledge of basis. I think the JS part is much more complicated than it has to be. I guess I will try to improve that in the future. 

I learned a lot about how Felxbox work. 

### Continued development

As already said above, I will have a closer look onto the JS part and see if I can solve it more elegant. Some bugs need also be solved.
